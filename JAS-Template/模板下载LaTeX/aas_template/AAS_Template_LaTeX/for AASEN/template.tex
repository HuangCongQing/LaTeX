\pagestyle{aasenheadings}



{\sl Acta Automatica} publishes high-level theoretic, design,
and applied results of scientific research in the field of
automation science and technology (monthly). The coverage of {\sl
Acta Automatica} includes but is not limited to: Automatic
control, systems theory and engineering, automation engineering and
applications, computer-aided technologies for automation systems,
robotics, artificial intelligence and intelligent control, pattern
recognition and image processing, information processing and
service, network based automation. We do not need a title for the
introduction chapter.

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Submission of papers}

Please log on {\sl Acta Automatica} website at http:
//www.aas.net.cn to submit your papers. Papers must be in Chinese or
in English. All submissions are acknowledged. DOC, PDF or PS files
that are ready to be printed can be accepted.

\subsection{Review stage}

All manuscripts submitted to {\sl Acta Automatica} are
subject to anonymous peer review. The members of the Editorial Board
choose the referees and make the final decision to accept or reject
the papers. Most manuscripts are returned to their authors for
revisions recommended by the editor and referees. Thus it will
typically take some months for a paper to be finally accepted.

\subsection{Final stage}

When you submit your final version, after your paper has been accepted, send an e-mail with complete contact
information for corresponding author. Include full mailing addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers,
and e-mail addresses. Corresponding author is the author to whom proofs of the paper and a complimentary
copy of the issue in which the paper appears will be sent.

For papers edited and typeset by Editorial Office of {\sl Acta
Automatica Sinica}, proofs are emailed to the corresponding author
only, and should be returned within 72 hours of receipt. Corrections
should be restricted to typesetting errors; any others may be
charged to the author and any queries from editors should be
answered in full. Extensive changes from the original are costly and
may delay publication while being reviewed by the editor. Authors
may be charged for the expense of making extensive changes in proof.



\section{Manuscript preparation}

Manuscripts should include the following parts: title, authors$'$
names, authors$'$ affiliations, abstract, keywords, text,
acknowledgments, appendixes (if necessary), collected references in
the order in which they are cited, short biography of every author,
tables and figures.


\subsection{Equations}

Number equations consecutively throughout the text with Arabic
numerals in parentheses: (1), (2), (3) etc. In appendixes use
the numbering sequence: (A1), (A2), (A3), etc. Place equation
numbers flush with the right margin.








Refer to ``(1),'' not ``Eq.\,(1)'' or ``equation (1),'' except at the
beginning of a sentence: ``Equation (1) is $\cdots$''
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
A_{cl}^{\rm T}P+PA_{cl}&PB_1\\
B_1TP&-I
\end{pmatrix}
<0
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
&{\sl g}_i(t)=i\int_t^\infty {\rm e}^{(A-SP_1)^{\rm T}(r-t)}[P_1A_1
x^{(i-1)}(r-\tau)+
\nonumber\\
&\ \ A_1^{\rm T}P_1 x^{(i-1)}(r+\tau)+A_1^{\rm T}{\sl
g}_{i-1}(r+\tau)]{\rm d}r,\ \ i=1,2,\cdots \tag{2}
\end{align}





\subsection{References}

References must be listed in the order they were cited (numerical
order). Number citations consecutively in square brackets$^{[1]}$.
The sentence punctuation follows the brackets$^{[2]}$. Multiple
references are numbered with one
brackets, such as [1,\,3], [3-5],
etc. When citing a section in a book, please give the
relevant page numbers$^{[1]}$. It is not necessary to mention the author(s) of the reference unless it is
relevant to your text. In sentences, refer simply to the reference number,
as ``in [6]''. Do not use ``Ref.\,[7]'' or ``reference [7]'' except at the
beginning of a sentence: ``Reference [7] shows.'' All publications cited
in the text should be presented in the reference list at the end of the
manuscript.

Please note that the references at the end of this document are in
the preferred referencing style. The names of all authors should be
given in the references unless the number of authors is greater than
six. If there are more than six authors, you may use ``et
al.''. Papers that have been submitted for publication but have not
been accepted should not be cited. Papers that have been accepted
for publication, but not yet specified for an issue should be\linebreak\onecolumn\begin{multicols}{2}%这一行用于第一页末尾


\noindent cited as ``to be published''$^{[4]}$. Such a reference may
be updated at the proof stage if the referenced paper has been
published by then. References should not contain abbreviations or
acronyms for the names of Journals, Conferences, Laboratories or
Companies, spell them out.




\subsection{Tables and figures}

Place table titles above the tables. Do not abbreviate ``Table.'' No
vertical lines in table. Statements that serve as captions for the
entire table do not need footnote letters.

Number figures in order of their appearance in the text and make
sure that every figure is cited. Every figure must have a caption
that is complete and intelligible in itself without reference to the
text.


\begin{center}
{\centering \vbox{\centerline{\psfig{figure=01.eps,width=7cm}}
\vskip2mm {\small Fig.\,1\quad Magnetization as a function of
applied field. Note that ``Fig.'' is abbreviated. There is a period
after the figure number, followed by a space. It is good practice to
explain the significance of the figure in the caption}}}
\end{center}


\begin{center}
{\centering \subfigure[Scale 1]{\psfig{figure=02a.eps,width=7.5cm}}
\\
\vbox{ \subfigure[Scale 2]{\psfig{figure=02b.eps,width=7.5cm}}
\vskip2mm {\small Fig.\,2\quad Real value (solid) and estimated
value (dotted)}}}
\end{center}


Please do not use color unless it is necessary for the proper
interpretation of your figures. Place figure captions below the
figures. If your figure has two parts, include the labels ``(a)''
and ``(b)'' as part of the artwork. Please verify that the figures
and tables you mention in the text actually exist. Please do not
include captions as part of the figures. Do not put borders around
the outside of your figures. Use the abbreviation ``Fig.'' even at
the beginning of a sentence.


Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather
than symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization,''
or ``Magnetization {\sl M}'', not just ``{\sl M}''. Put units in
parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. As in Fig.\,1, for
example, write ``Magnetization (kA/m)'' or ``Magnetization
(kA$\cdot$m$^{-1}$)'', not just ``kA/m''. Do not label






\noindent   axes with a
ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature
(K),'' not ``Temperature/K.''

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization
(kA/m)'' or ``Magnetization (10$^{3}$\,A/m).'' Do not write
``Magnetization (A/m)$\times$1\,000'' because the reader would not
know whether the top axis label in Fig.\,1 meant 16\,000\,A/m or 0.016\,A/m. Figure labels should be legible.


\section{Publication principles}

It is a condition of publication that manuscripts submitted to {\sl
Acta Automatica} have not been published and will not be submitted
or published elsewhere in any other language, without the written
consent of the Editorial Office of {\sl Acta Automatica Sinica}. Do
not submit a reworked version of a paper you have submitted or
published elsewhere. Do

not publish ``preliminary'' data or results. It is the obligation of
the authors to cite relevant prior work. The submitting author is
responsible for obtaining agreement of all coauthors and any consent
required from sponsors before submitting a paper. {\sl Acta
Automatica} strongly discourages courtesy authorship. It is not the
responsibility of the Editors, or the Publisher to confirm that each
author approves of the paper as submitted or even knows that his or
her name is attached to it. Responsibility for the contents of the
paper rests upon the authors and not upon {\sl Acta Automatica
Sinica}, the Editors, or the Publisher.



\section{Conclusion}

Typical functions of the conclusion of a scientific paper include 1)
summing up, 2) a statement of conclusions, 3) a statement of
recommendations, and 4) a graceful termination. Any one of these, or
any combination, may be appropriate for a particular paper. Some
papers do not need a separate concluding section, particularly if
the conclusions have already been stated in the introduction.
